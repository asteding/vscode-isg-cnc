### Problem to solve

(What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, "As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value).")


### Intended users

(Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer), personas, or specific company roles (e.g. Release Manager). It's okay to write "Unknown" and fill this field in later.)


### User experience goal

(What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? 
For example, "The user should be able to use the UI/API to perform a specific task")


### Proposal

(How are we going to solve the problem?)


### Further details

(Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better.)


### Permissions and Security

(What permissions are required to perform the described actions? Are they consistent with the existing permissions as documented for users, groups, and projects as appropriate? Is the proposed behavior consistent between the UI, API, and other access methods (e.g. email replies)?)


### Documentation

(How will the feature be documented?)


### Availability & Testing

(What risks does this change pose to our availability? How might it affect the quality of the product? What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed? Will it require cross-browser testing?)


### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

(Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this.)


### What is the type of buyer?

(What is the buyer persona for this feature? In which enterprise tier should this feature go?)


### Is this a cross-stage feature?

(Communicate if this change will affect multiple Stage Groups or product areas. We recommend always start with the assumption that a feature request will have an impact into another Group. Loop in the most relevant PM and Product Designer from that Group to provide strategic support to help align the Group's broader plan and vision, as well as to avoid UX and technical debt.)
