# Installation

## Requirements

Visual Studio Code V1.59.0 or higher

- Install Visual Studio Code first.
- Install the extension isg-cnc.

There are two ways to do that:  

1. You can install the extension in the Visual Studio Code extension manager by searching for isg-cnc.
1. If you dont have internet you can download the vsix file from marketplaces and install extension locally.
